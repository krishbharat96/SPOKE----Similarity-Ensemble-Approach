# SPOKE----Similarity-Ensemble-Approach
SEA Data within SPOKE

In order to extract assay data from SPOKE, we used parts of ChEMBL db to obtain compound to protein assay data. These data include different types of assays such as IC50, EC50, logEC50 etc. along with filtration parameters to obtain the best curated data possible.
